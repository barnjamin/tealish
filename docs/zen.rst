The Zen of Tealish
==================

| Readability is more important than writeability.
| Code is for both machines and humans.
| Explicit is better than implicit.
| Except when it comes to stacks.
| Static is better than dynamic.
| Verbose is better than terse,
| Except when it's not.
| Ambiguity must be avoided.
| Pragmatism always beats purity.
| Surprises are for birthdays.
| Boring is good.
| Magic is best left to wizards.
| Freedom of implementation is important,
| But freedom of code style is not.
| Optimization of resources is important,
| But rarely more important than readability.
| The best code is often the code that doesn't exist.
| But the bug is also often the code that doesn't exist.
| Embrace the uniqueness of the AVM.

Inspired by `PEP-20 - The Zen of Python <https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/>`_.
